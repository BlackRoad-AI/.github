# BlackRoad Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

> **"The agent doesn't need to be smart. It needs to know who to call."**

Just as BlackRoad routes requests to the right intelligence, we believe in connecting people to the right conversations and collaborations. We're building infrastructure that empowers—not gatekeeps.

## Our Standards

### Be Direct

- Say what you mean. Route communication efficiently.
- Technical disagreement is healthy. Personal attacks are not.
- Give feedback that helps, not feedback that hurts.

### Be Constructive

- Propose solutions, not just problems
- Share knowledge freely—we route to intelligence, we don't hoard it
- Help others learn the routing patterns

### Be Inclusive

- Everyone can contribute to the routing layer
- Different perspectives improve routing decisions
- Accessibility matters—route around barriers, don't create them

### Be Professional

- Focus on what's best for the project and community
- Respect differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully

## Unacceptable Behavior

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks
- Trolling, insulting comments, or deliberate provocation
- Publishing others' private information without consent
- Abuse of the reporting process
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:
- All BlackRoad repositories and projects
- Community discussions (issues, PRs, discussions)
- Official communication channels
- Representing BlackRoad at events or online

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **Document** the incident (screenshots, links, timestamps)
2. **Report** via email to conduct@blackroad.ai or contact a maintainer directly
3. **Await** response—we take all reports seriously

### Response Process

| Severity | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Minor (first offense) | Private warning, coaching |
| Moderate | Temporary suspension from participation |
| Severe | Permanent ban from all BlackRoad spaces |

All reports will be reviewed confidentially. We will not retaliate against good-faith reporters.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

## The Routing Principle

Remember: In the BlackRoad ecosystem, we route problems to solutions and people to opportunities. Let's extend that principle to our community—route conversations toward understanding, disagreements toward resolution, and newcomers toward contribution.
